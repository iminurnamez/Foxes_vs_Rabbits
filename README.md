Foxes_vs_Rabbits
================
A simulation of foxes, rabbits and grass. 

- Easy on the grass. Increasing the grass total has a significant impact on the number of rabbits and can lead to lag.

- The distribution of the grass on the screen is random. To control grass distribution, set starting grasses to 0
  and place the grass yourself.

- Running the sim with no foxes results in more predictable and repetitive population cycles.
