Foxes_vs_Rabbits
================
A simulation of foxes, rabbits and grass. 

- Stay off the grass. Increasing the amount of grass has a significant impact on the number of rabbits and leads to lag.

- The distribution of the grass on the screen is random. To control grass distribution, set starting grasses to 0
  and place the grass yourself.

- Running the sim with no foxes results in more predictable and repetitive population cycles.

ISSUES:

  - Zoomers. Rabbits that move faster than the rest of the rabbits, which should all move at the same rate.
